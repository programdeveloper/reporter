@version 1.0.0

This plugin lets you extract a thumbnail from a video file. The video file must be
supported by the platform, and the thumbnail will be written to a location you 
specify. 

Supports: iOS 6+, Android 2.3+

The license is MIT, so feel free to use, enhance, etc. If you do make changes that would
benefit the community, it would be great if you would contribute them back to the original
plugin, but that is not required.

## Repository

Available on [Github](https://github.com/photokandyStudios/PKVideoThumbnail). Contributions welcome!

## Minimum Requirements

* Cordova 2.9 or higher (tested 3.4)
* iOS 6 or higher; Android 2.3 or higher

## Installation

Add the plugin using Cordova's CLI:

```
cordova plugin add com.photokandy.videothumbnail
```

## Use

All interaction with the library is through `window.PKVideoThumbnail`. To request a thumbnail from a video file, simply:

```
window.PKVideoThumbnail.createThumbnail ( sourceVideoPath, targetThumbnailPath, success, failure );
```

Both the source and target path should be a `file://` absolute URL. If using `file://localhost/`, you should eliminate `localhost` from the `targetThumbnailPath` for proper functionality. The intermediate directories specified in `targetThumbnailPath` must also exist (missing directories are *not* created).

The `success` method receives the `targetThumbnailPath` in case the method needs to do further work on the image. The `error` method often receives the `targetThumbnailPath` on iOS, but will receive an error message indicating cause of failure on Android. 

The thumbnail obtained is platform and video-specific. There is no support for requesting thumbnails of different sizes; if you need this, you can alter the thumbnail after it is written out to storage.
